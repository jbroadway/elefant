## Built for designers

**Compiled, ultra-fast templates**

Elefant compiles your templates into secure, readable PHP code, so rendering is as fast as
possible and also takes advantage of bytecode caching (e.g., APC).

**Dead simple, concise template tags**

[Familiar syntax](https://www.elefantcms.com/docs/2.2/designers/template-language) to other template
languages, with some added conveniences for dynamic embeds and internationalization.

**Clean, easy to use site editor for your users**

Elefant comes out of the box with a [full-featured CMS](https://www.elefantcms.com/docs/2.2/user-manual)
for your users. You can even [white label it](https://www.elefantcms.com/docs/2.2/designers/white-labelling-the-cms).

**Syntax highlighted template and CSS editor**

Sophisticated [in-browser editing](https://www.elefantcms.com/docs/2.2/designers)
with highlights and references at your finger tips.

**Live preview while editing templates and CSS**

Preview in real time as you make changes. Or if you prefer, edit files directly with
your editor of choice.

**Integrates with 960 grid system and jQuery**

Or any other CSS grid/layout system, giving you complete control over your designs. Theme builder also provides defaults for Twitter Bootstrap.

## Built for developers

**Quickly built custom apps**

With all the tools you need, and a very low learning curve, Elefant gets you writing
code quickly.

[input validation](https://www.elefantcms.com/docs/2.2/developers/input-validation),
and automatic prevention of XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, and other types of attacks.

**Very fast and low memory**

Elefant uses less memory than any of the major frameworks, so you can serve more visitors with the same resources.
Benchmarks: [MVC layer](https://github.com/jbroadway/phpmark-elefant/blob/master/php-framework-benchmark-results.md),
[database access](https://github.com/jbroadway/php-dbal-bench), and [template rendering](https://github.com/jbroadway/template-bench).

**Solid debugging tools**

Debug mode prints full traces with highlighted source code and variable state to
help you fix bugs faster.

**Minimalist HMVC/Model2 architecture**

Elefant takes a [unique but proven approach](https://www.elefantcms.com/docs/2.2/developers/request-response-cycle)
that helps minimize boilerplate without sacrificing code organization as your project grows.

**Shared apps to save you time**

From blogs to user management, events to search, Elefant saves you time not reinventing
the wheel with [high quality shared apps](https://www.elefantcms.com/listings).

**Thoroughly unit-tested**

[extensive unit tests](https://github.com/jbroadway/elefant/tree/master/tests),
ensuring a stable base to build on.
