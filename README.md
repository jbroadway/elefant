## Built for designers

**Compiled, ultra-fast templates**

Elefant compiles your templates into secure, readable PHP code, so rendering is as fast as
possible and also takes advantage of bytecode caching (e.g., APC).

**Dead simple, concise template tags**

[Familiar syntax](https://www.elefantcms.com/docs/2.0/designers/template-language) to other template
languages, with some added conveniences for dynamic embeds and internationalization.

**Clean, easy to use site editor for your users**

Elefant comes out of the box with a [full-featured CMS](https://www.elefantcms.com/docs/2.0/user-manual)
for your users. You can even [white label it](https://www.elefantcms.com/docs/2.0/designers/white-labelling-the-cms).

**Syntax highlighted template and CSS editor**

Sophisticated [in-browser editing](https://www.elefantcms.com/docs/2.0/designers)
with highlights and references at your finger tips.

**Live preview while editing templates and CSS**

Preview in real time as you make changes. Or if you prefer, edit files directly with
your editor of choice.

**Integrates with 960 grid system and jQuery**

Or any other CSS grid/layout system, giving you complete control over your designs. Theme builder also provides defaults for Twitter Bootstrap.

that helps minimize boilerplate without sacrificing code organization as your project grows.
